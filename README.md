# SpaceRaceUnlimited
3D racing video game made with Unity.  
Instead of cars, you will be controlling spaceships which can move in one extra dimension for added challenge.  
Uses [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) to support Local Multiplayer via LAN.  
Here is a [presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51WzE97PYbs) of the project.
